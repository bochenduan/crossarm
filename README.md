# **Optimisation of Asset Management Maintenance: Crossarm Classification**


##Project Description
Using United Energy's image data set, crossarms from power poles are classified into wood or steel. This enhances asset management maintenance as it can potentially reduce the time to look through the photos. 

There are 2 major parts to this:
* Image Pre-Processing - Component labelling is used to determine the usefulness of the picture (whether a crossarm is present)
* Feature Based Approach - Flagging keypoints and using training model to predict whether the crossarm in an image is wood or steel

Please read the respective documents for each approach to get a better understand on how the script works. Comments are also present in the scripts to further improve understanding.
